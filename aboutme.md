subtitle: My Journey into the World of Data Science
---

I am a Data Science student, with a passion for at-risk youth, funding and program growth for youth that age out of the system.
My previous experience in micro-level social work led me to realize I can make the most difference in my field at a macro-level with data as my tool of choice. I have temporarily put my life on hold to gain the education I need to make these changes for myself and hopefully someday, the world.
