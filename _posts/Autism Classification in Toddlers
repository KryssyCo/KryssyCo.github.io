Beginning this project, I developed the hypothesis that by using the date provided by Autism Spectrum Disorders Test App, we can predict the probability of a toddler < 36 months showing or developing ASD traits.

I used a variety of the Q-Chat Questions 1 thru 10 and demographics per observation to design a simple prediction model. With the right model I hope to predict the probability of identifying a toddler showing Autism Spectrum Disorder traits.

I believed that by identifying the possibility of autism early parents and/or guardian can consider taking steps to identify special needs prior to a child entering School. This app can be a valuable tool in making that identification.

After running the data on a Gradient Boost Classifier and obtaining a roc/auc score on the validation set and the test set, using only the aforementioned features. Both seemed to still have some overfitting because the score was so high 99.7% and 99% respectively.

The results suggest the need to use all 10 questions to be able to make an accurate prediction using the app, because the baseline scores were better across all models.

Finally, I think it is safe to argue that with earlier classification and diagnosis, a child may have a better educational experience both socially and on a personal success level. In addition, their parents can gain the necessary help and education to help their children reach their full potential.
